# Advent of Code 2024 (in COBOL)

Absolute COBOL beginner, this is mostly just for fun (so please don't judge the code).

## Setup

This uses the [GnuCOBOL](https://gnucobol.sourceforge.io/) compiler.

1. Run `set-env.cmd` in the compiler directory.
2. Change into the relevant directory.
3. Run `cobc -x task.cob` to generate an executable file.
